It's a PowerBI Project.
I created a dashboard that includes: 
Total Reveneu, RevPAR, DSRN(Net daily revenue from direct bookings), Occupancy%(Percentage of available rooms occupied), ADR(Average daily rate per room), Realisation%, added filter based on city, room, hotels, week No, Month, and Day.

Final Dashboard:
